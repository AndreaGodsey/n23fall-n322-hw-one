# Information

This website contains a home page, and a page that appears after searching typed information with the click of a button. Both pages are styled with text and images.

The home page contains three hero images and text, as well as two semantic-ui elements. Firstly, the statistics counder, to show how many new visitors and creators login or create an account daily. The social media icons are created by also using semantic-ui, as well as manipulating it to space evenly just above the footer of the page. There is also a progress bar that was created, to display the basic stats of any pokemon on the search page. The bars barely move, due to the widths of the stats bars themselves. This is meant to make it obvious to the viewer that these are only a pokemon's basic stats. The assignment mentioned needing only one semantic-ui element, but I was able to figure out how to add more than one to the project! After some research into other Pokemon websites, this was the final result!

I have also figured out how to change colors of buttons, change the fonts, etc. through typing out the style next to the element on my index and name page.
